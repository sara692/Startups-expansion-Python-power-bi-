📊 Startup Expansion Analysis

This project analyzes store expansion and performance across different states using Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data preprocessing, and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.

🚀 Project Workflow

## 1-Data Import & Cleaning (Python)

-Loaded raw dataset.
-Handled missing values & inconsistencies.
-Renamed and formatted columns.
-Applied feature engineering (e.g., Performance_State, deviation %, below target flag).

## 2-Preprocessing & Processing (Python)

### 1-Performed statistical checks for outliers:
-Used standard deviation method to detect anomalies.
-Plotted histograms to visually confirm data distribution and validate no major outliers.

### 2-Created new derived metrics:
-Profit deviation percentage.
-Performance categories.
-Losing store indicator.

### 3-Exported a cleaned dataset for visualization.

## 3-Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
### 1-Designed an interactive dashboard to explore:
-Store distribution by state.
-Profit contribution by region.
-Store performance segmentation.
-Impact of marketing spend.

📈 Dashboard Preview

## The dashboard highlights:

-KPIs: Total Profit, Marketing Spend, Number of States, Number of Stores.
-Pie Chart: Distribution of store performance states.
-Bar Charts: Profit contribution by state & performance split between losing and winning stores.

🛠️ Tech Stack

## Python → Data Cleaning & Processing
### pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
## Power BI → Dashboard & Visualization

🔮 Insights & Findings

-California has the highest store count and profit contribution, but also a notable number of losing stores.
-Performance distribution shows a significant percentage of stores falling into “Very Poor” (-25%+).
-Marketing spend alone does not guarantee profit; performance varies significantly by state.
-Data quality check confirmed no major outliers, ensuring reliable performance insights.

📌 Next Steps

Incorporate time-series trends (profit over time).

Add predictive modeling for store success probability.

Enhance geospatial visualization for store expansion planning.
